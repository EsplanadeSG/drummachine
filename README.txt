A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/teropa/pen/JLjXGK.

 An experimental drum machine powered by a deep neural network. 

To use it, define a seed pattern on the left, and use the "generate" button. A neural network will dream up a continuation to your seed pattern.

Uses the "Drums RNN" pretrained model from Google Magenta https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/drums_rnn

Running on Magenta.js, TensorFlow.js and Tone.js
